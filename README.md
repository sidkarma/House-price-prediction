House Price Prediction using Python and Various Libraries
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features. We'll use Python and several popular libraries for different aspects of the project.

1. Data Collection and Cleaning using NumPy and Pandas:
We begin by collecting a dataset of housing-related features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. We'll use Pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical operations to clean and preprocess the dataset.
2. Data Visualization with Matplotlib:
After cleaning the data, we'll employ Matplotlib to create insightful visualizations. This will include plotting correlations between features and house prices, distribution of prices, and other exploratory visualizations to understand the dataset better.
3. Model Building using Scikit-Learn:
For building the predictive model, we'll utilize Scikit-Learn (sklearn). We'll split the dataset into training and testing sets, preprocess features, choose an appropriate regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.), and train the model on the training set.
4. Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning:
After training, we'll evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R-squared score. We may also perform hyperparameter tuning to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
5. Integration with Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm:
We'll use Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis, step-by-step development, and showcasing the results. Additionally, Visual Studio Code and PyCharm will be used for efficient code development and collaboration.
6. Deployment with Python Flask for HTTP Server:
To make our model accessible, we'll use Python Flask to create a web server. The Flask application will expose an API endpoint to which clients can send feature inputs, and it will respond with predicted house prices.
7. User Interface with HTML/CSS/JavaScript:
For a user-friendly interface, we'll create a simple web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can input features like square footage, bedrooms, etc., and upon submission, the UI will send a request to the Flask API, receive the prediction, and display it to the user.
By integrating these tools and technologies, we'll create a complete end-to-end system for house price prediction, from data cleaning and model training to model deployment and user interaction through a web interface.
